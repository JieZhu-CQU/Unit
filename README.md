# Unit
An Mathematica package to do numeric calculation and dimensional analysis in units and physical constants.

Because Mathematica already has Context ```Units` ```, I have to use the name `Unit`.

For usage, see examples in `UnitDoc.nb`.

This package is far from completed. Only when I need to add functionality I add new features. I wish you can understand the examples in file `UnitDoc.nb` :-).

To install this package, run `$UserBaseDirectory // SystemOpen` in Mathematica and Move this folder into the **Applications** subfolder.
